		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Take me back to Letterkenny, Combermere, and Barry's Bay.<br/>
			I will walk through fields of clover and the scent of fresh mown hay.<br/>
			With horse and plough I'll till my soil and ne'er rest til end of day.<br/>
			I'll find a wife to share my life. To the woods no more I'll stray.</p>

			<p>From the shores of Madawaska in the year of 78,<br/>
			We paddled north by river up to Opeongo Lake.<br/>
			T'was my father and my grandfather and I my fathers son.<br/>
			We lived by plough and trap line 'til the year of 81.</p>

			<p>We set out one fine spring morning in the year of 81.<br/>
			There was my old grandfather and I, his fine grandson.<br/>
			To check our traps for fox and mink and to carry home our prize,<br/>
			To north arm we did paddle to where we'd set our lines.</p>

			<p>We set shore at Green Lake Portage and grandfather led the way,<br/>
			To a trap we'd set a week before it was the last one for the day.<br/>
			As we neared the site, there was no sound.  There was no cause to fear,<br/>
			But Grandfather motioned stay back son and cautiously drew near.</p>

			<p>Then a deathly roar crashed through the air, a beast then did arise.<br/>
			And angered by a bloody wound to us, it turned it's eyes.<br/>
			As Grandfather turned to face the foe he ordered me away.<br/>
			"Go my son be on your way or death you'll know this day."</p>

			<p>When I returned to Green Lake portage with my father that same night,<br/>
			Both bear and man lay cold and still, for no-one had won the fight.<br/>
			We took grandfather back with us with tears in both our eyes,<br/>
			And laid him to his final rest . It's there that he still lies.</p>

			<p>So head ye bold young fellows if north you plan to stray <br/>
			Towards the Opeongo or the shores of Annie's Bay.<br/>
			There's a lone grave on the hillside where John Dennison does sleep;<br/>
			A deathly warning to all men. "Beware the forest deep."</p>
