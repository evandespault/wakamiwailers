		<div class="lyrics">

			<p>As I sat down one evening within a small cafe,<br/>
			A forty year old waitress to me these words did say:</p>

			<p>"I see that you are a logger, and not just a common bum,<br/>
			'Cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with is thumb.</p>

			<p>My lover was a logger, there's none like him today;<br/>
			If you'd pour whiskey on it he could eat a bale of hay</p>

			<p>He never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide;<br/>
			He'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside.</p>

			<p>My lover came to see me upon one freezing day;<br/>
			He held me in his fond embrace which broke three vertebrae.</p>

			<p>He kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;<br/>
			I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw.</p>

			<p>I saw my lover leaving, sauntering through the snow,<br/>
			Going gaily homeward at forty-eight below.</p>

			<p>The weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best;<br/>
			At a hundred degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest.</p>

			<p>It froze clean through to China, it froze to the stars above;<br/>
			At a thousand degrees below zero, it froze my logger love.</p>

			<p>They tried in vain to thaw him, and would you believe me, sir<br/>
			They made him into axeblades, to chop the Douglas fir.</p>

			<p>And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come,<br/>
			And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb."</p>
