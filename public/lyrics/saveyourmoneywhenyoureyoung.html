		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Come all you jolly fellows, and I'll sing you a song,<br/>
			It's all about the shantyboys and it won't take too long,<br/>
			For it's now that I regret the day while working out in the cold;<br/>
			Save your money while you're young my boys<br/>
			You'll need it when you're old.</p>

			<p>For once I was a shantyboy, oh wasn't I a lad!<br/>
			Now it's the way I spent my money, oh wasn't it too bad!<br/>
			For it's now that I regret the day while working out in the cold,<br/>
			Save your money while you're young, me boys<br/>
			You'll need it when you're old.</p>

			<p>And if you are a married man I'll tell you what to do,<br/>
			Be kind to your wife and family as you were pledged to do.<br/>
			And stay away from grog shops where liquor is bought and sold,<br/>
			Save your money while you're young me boys<br/>
			You'll need it when you're old.</p>

			<p>And if you are a single lad I'll tell you what to do,<br/>
			Just find yourself a pretty girl and one who will prove true.<br/>
			Just find yourself a pretty girl and one who's not to bold,<br/>
			Who will stick with you through life and be a comfort when you're old.</p>
