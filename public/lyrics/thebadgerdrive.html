		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>There's one class of men in this country<br/>
			Who's names are not mentioned in song.<br/>
			But now that their trade is advancing,<br/>
			They'll come out on top before long.<br/>
			They say that our sailors have danger,<br/>
			And likewise our warriors bold.<br/>
			But none know the life of the driver<br/>
			How he suffers from hardship and toll.</p>

			<p><b>With our pike poles and peaveys<br/>
			And bateaus and all.<br/>
			They're sure to drive out in the spring<br/>
			That's the time.<br/>
			With their cocks on their boots<br/>
			As they get on the logs<br/>
			It's hard to get over their time.</b></p>

			<p>Well Bill Dority, he is the manager<br/>
			And he's a good man oat the trade.<br/>
			For when he's around seeking drivers<br/>
			He's like a train going down grade.<br/>
			But still he's a man who's kind hearted<br/>
			On his word you always depend.<br/>
			For never a man that's worked with him<br/>
			But likes to go with him again.</p>

			<p>Well the drive it is just below badger,<br/>
			And everything is working grand.<br/>
			With a jolly good crew of good badgers<br/>
			And Ronald Kelly in command.<br/>
			For Ronald's the boss on the river<br/>
			And he is one man who's alive.<br/>
			He drove the wood off of Victoria.<br/>
			Now he's out on the main river drive.</p>

			<p>Well now to conclude and to finish.<br/>
			I hope that you all will agree.<br/>
			In wishing success to all badgers<br/>
			And the A.N.D. Company.<br/>
			Long may they live for to flourish<br/>
			And continue to chop, drive and roll.<br/>
			And long may the business be managed<br/>
			By Bill Dority and Mr. Cole.</p>
