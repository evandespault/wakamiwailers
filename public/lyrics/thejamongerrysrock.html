		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Come all you bold young shantyboys and hear as I relate<br/>
			Concerning a young river boss and his untimely fate,<br/>
			Concerning young river boss so handsome, true and brave,<br/>
			It was on the jam on Gerry's Rocks he met his watery grave.</p>

			<p>It was on a Sunday morning as well you all will hear,<br/>
			Our jam was piled mountains high, we could not keep it clear.<br/>
			Our foreman cried "Turn out brave boys, with hearts devoid of fear,<br/>
			We'll break the jam on Gerry's Rocks, to Ellingtown we'll steer."</p>

			<p>Some of the boys were willing while others they were not,<br/>
			To work on the jam on Sunday they did not think they ought,<br/>
			Till six of our Canadian boys all volunteered to go<br/>
			And smash the jam on Gerry's Rocks with their foreman, young Munroe.</p>

			<p>They had not rolled off many logs when they heard his young voice say.<br/>
			"I'll have you boys be on your guard, this jam will soon give way."<br/>
			His words were scarcely spoken when the jam did break and go,<br/>
			And carried off the Canadian lads and their foreman, young Munroe.</p>

			<p>When the rest of those young shantymen the sad news they did hear<br/>
			In search of their brave comrades to the riverside did steer,<br/>
			Meanwhile their mangled bodies afloading down did go,<br/>
			While dead and bleeding at the bank lay the corpse of young Munroe.</p>

			<p>They buried him in sorrow's depths, it was on the first of May,<br/>
			On a green bank by the riverside there grew a hemlock gray,<br/>
			Enscribed on that gray hemlock by the riverside did grow<br/>
			Was the name, the date of this sad fate of our foreman young Munroe.</p>
