		<div class="lyrics">

			<p>Come all you true born shanty-boys and listen on to me,<br/>
			And when that e’er a woodsman that you may chance to see<br/>
			We are a merry set of boys; so handsome, young and fine.<br/>
			We spend a jolly winter a cutting down the pine.</p>

			<p><b>So it’s hurry up Harry, and Tom or Dick or Joe<br/>
			And you may take the pail boys, and for the water go.<br/>
			In the middle of the splashing, the cook will dinner cry,<br/>
			And you ought to see them hurry up for fear they’d lose their pie!</b></p>

			<p>There’s blackstrap molasses, squaw buns as hard as rock<br/>
			Tea that’s boiled in an old tin pail that smells just like your socks<br/>
			The beans they are sour and the porridge thick as dough,<br/>
			And when we stash them in our craw, it’s to the woods we go</p>

			<p>A hitching up our braces and binding up our feet<br/>
			A grinding up our axes for our kind is hard to beat!<br/>
			A shouldering up our cross cut saws and though the woods we go,<br/>
			We make a jolly set of boys a-trudging through the snow.</p>

			<p>So deeply in the tree of pine we notch to guide its fall<br/>
			And not a man amongst us will hear the timber call;<br/>
			And when it crashes to the ground we’ll fall to with a will,<br/>
			A trimming up the branches and a swearing fit to kill.</p>

			<p>Arriving at the shanty, wet, tired, and with wet feet,<br/>
			We all take off our socks and boots our supper for to eat.<br/>
			At nine o’clock or there about into our bunks we’ll crawl<br/>
			To sleep away the too short hours until the morning call.</p>
