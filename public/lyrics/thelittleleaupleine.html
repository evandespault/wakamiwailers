		<div class="lyrics">

			<p>One evening last June as I rambled<br/>
			O’re the hills and the valleys alone,<br/>
			The meadowlarks notes were melodious;<br/>
			How merry the whippoorwill sang!<br/>
			The frogs in the marshes were croaking,<br/>
			And the tree toads were whistling for rain,<br/>
			And the partridge around me were drumming<br/>
			On the banks of the Little L’eau Pleine.</p>

			<p>As the sun in the west was declining<br/>
			It tainted the tree tops with red,<br/>
			My wondering steps bored me onward,<br/>
			Never caring where’er they led,<br/>
			Till I chanced for to meet a young school ma’am,<br/>
			Charmed in a horrible strain.<br/>
			She lamented her lost jolly raftsman<br/>
			From the banks of the Little L’eau Pleine.</p>

			<p>“Pray tell me what kind of a fellow<br/>
			And what kind of clothing he wore.<br/>
			For I did belong to the river<br/>
			And I might have seen him before.”<br/>
			“His pants they were made of two wheat sacks,<br/>
			With a patch a foot square on each knee.<br/>
			His jacket and shirt they were dyed with<br/>
			The bark of a butternut tree.”</p>

			<p>“He wore a red sash round his middle’<br/>
			And an end hanging down on each side.<br/>
			His boots numbers ten of strong cowhide,<br/>
			And the heel about four inches wide.<br/>
			His name it was Honest John Murphy<br/>
			And on it there n’er was a stain,<br/>
			For he loved the West Constant River<br/>
			That’s the reason he left the L’eau Pleine.”</p>

			<p>“If that be the kind of your Johnny,<br/>
			T’was he that I did know well.<br/>
			These sad tidings I will tell you,<br/>
			Your Johnny was drowned in the dell.<br/>
			We buried him ‘neath the low valley,<br/>
			And you’ll never see him again,<br/>
			For the stones mark the sod o’er your Johnny.<br/>
			He lies far from the Little L’eau Pleine.”</p>
