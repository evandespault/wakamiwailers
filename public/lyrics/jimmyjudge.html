		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Jimmy Judge was this young man's name, I'm going to let you know,<br/>
			And I mean to sing his praises wherever I do go.<br/>
			For he was as fine a young man as ever the sun shone on,<br/>
			And 'twas on that Bonneshai River that he was drownded on.</p>

			<p>Come all you wild young heroes that run the restless deep,<br/>
			Just think of the sad fate of him who now beneath you sleeps.<br/>
			It was of as fine a young man as ever the sun shined on,<br/>
			Down on those foaming waters he found a dismal doom.</p>

			<p>It was on the Bonneshai River aways below Renfrew<br/>
			That he went to break the jam and with it he went through.<br/>
			In spite of his activity his precious life to save,<br/>
			In vain was his exertion; he found a watery grave.</p>

			<p>It was early the next morning the raftman all did join.<br/>
			They all sailed out together this young man for to find.<br/>
			They searched the deep in every place where the current does so fly,<br/>
			It was a fisher boy, as I am told, his floating corpe did spy.</p>

			<p>It would melt your heart with pity when they brought him on the shore<br/>
			For to see his handsome features with the rocks all cut and tore,<br/>
			To see so fine a young man all in his youthful bloom.<br/>
			Down on those foaming waters he found a dismal doom.</p>

			<p>Oh the lass that loved him dearly, she cried, "Now I'm undone!"<br/>
			Likewise his aged parents, they cried "My darlin son."<br/>
			But now he is in Paradise and happy he may be,<br/>
			For I hope in heaven his soul will shine for all eternity.</p>
