		<div class="lyrics">

			<p><b>From bow to stern she was wood and steel<br/>
			This lake had seen no better<br/>
			With wood to burn she'd steam along<br/>
			With a boom of logs behind her<br/>
			6 inch beams and 2x4s<br/>
			With sheets of steel beneath her<br/>
			A winch to pull her up on shore <br/>
			Across both land and water</b></p>

			<p>Built she was in twenty six<br/>
			Or was it twenty seven?<br/>
			By Morses men...old Joe Lapine <br/>
			And I think Ernie Collins<br/>
			From Devon camp they hauled her down<br/>
			To the shores of Browns Bay water<br/>
			In Wakami she'd chug along <br/>
			No other tug could catch her<br/>
			With paddle, steam and a winch to pull<br/>
			At the other end a cable<br/>
			Wrapped round a tree to bring her out<br/>
			And that's the way we moved her.</p>

			<p>It was big Frank Brown who drove the tug<br/>
			He was the Blondes true master<br/>
			And Harry Clause down in the hold<br/>
			Would make the boat move faster<br/>
			With a curse and poke the fire he'd stoke<br/>
			And make the flames go higher<br/>
			Keep her in steam so she sweats her beams<br/>
			And her boiler does blow over</p>

			<p>Well from time to time the boys they would fight<br/>
			For Harry liked his liquor<br/>
			Frank'd send him ashore for a day or more<br/>
			With a stack wood and a sober head<br/>
			In a place where there's no spirit<br/>
			And some time to think things over<br/>
			He’d climb on board and they's head for shore<br/>
			And toast the Blonde soon after</p>
