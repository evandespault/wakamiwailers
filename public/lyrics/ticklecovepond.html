		<div class="lyrics">

			<p>In cuttin' and haulin', in frost and in snow,<br/>
			We're up against trouble that few people know<br/>
			And only with patience and courage and grit,<br/>
			And eatin' plain food can we keep ourselves fit.<br/>
			The hard and the easy we take as it comes,<br/>
			And when ponds freeze over, we shorten our runs,<br/>
			To hurry my haulin', with spring comin' on<br/>
			Near lost me my mare out on Tickle Cove Pond.</p>

			<p><b>Lay hold, William Oldford, lay hold William White<br/>
			Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might,<br/>
			Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can,<br/>
			And give me a lift for poor Kit on the pond.</b></p>

			<p>I knew that the ice became weaker each day<br/>
			But still took the risk and kept haulin' away,<br/>
			One evenin' in April, bound home with a load,<br/>
			The mare showed some haltin' upon the ice road.<br/>
			She knew more than I did, as matters turned out,<br/>
			And lucky for me had I joined in her doubt,<br/>
			She turned round her head and with tears in her eyes<br/>
			As if she were sayin', "You're risking our lives!"</p>

			<p>All this I ignored with a whip-handle blow<br/>
			For men are too stupid dumb creatures to know:<br/>
			The very next moment, the pond gave a sigh<br/>
			And up to our necks went poor Kitty and I.<br/>
			Now if I had taken wise Kitty's advice<br/>
			I never would take the short cut on the ice,<br/>
			Poor creature, she's dead and poor creature, she's gone,<br/>
			I'll near get my wood out of Tickle Cove Pond.</p>

			<p>I raised an alarm you could hear for a mile,<br/>
			And neighbours turned up in a very short while;<br/>
			You can always depend on the Oldfords and Whites<br/>
			To render assistance in all your bad plights.<br/>
			The bowline was fastened around the mare's neck<br/>
			William White for a shanty song made a request<br/>
			There was no time for thinkin', no time for delay,<br/>
			So straight from his head came this song rightaway:</p>

			<p><b>Lay hold, William Oldford, Lay hold, William White,<br/>
			Lay hold of the hawser and pull al your might,<br/>
			Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can -<br/>
			And with that we got Kit out of Tickle Cove Pond.</b></p>
