		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Oh it's well I do remember the year of forty-five,
			I think myself quite lucky to find myself alive.<br/>
			I harnessed up my horses my business to pursue,<br/>
			And I went a-hauling white pines as I often used to do.</p>

			<p>Now I only hauled out one load, I should have hauled out four,<br/>
			I went down to Omemee and I could not haul no more.<br/>
			The tavern being open, good liquor flowing free,<br/>
			And I hadn't finished one glass and another was poured for me.</p>

			<p>Now I met with an acquaintance, and I dare not tell his name,<br/>
			He was going to a dance and I thought I'd do the same.<br/>
			He was going to a dance where the fiddle was sweetly played,<br/>
			And the boys and girls all danced till the breaking of the day.</p>

			<p>So I put me saddle up on me arm and headed for the barn<br/>
			To saddle up my gray nag, not meaning any harm.<br/>
			I saddled up my gray nag and rode away so still<br/>
			And I never drew a long breath till I came to Downeyville.</p>

			<p>By the time I got to Downeyville the night was far advanced,<br/>
			I got up on the floor for to have a little dance.<br/>
			The fiddler he was rested, his arm being stout and strong,<br/>
			Played the reels of old Ireland for four hours long.</p>

			<p>Now the foreman followed after me, I've heard the people say.<br/>
			He must have had a pilot or he'd never have found the way.<br/>
			He looked in every keyhole that he could see a light<br/>
			Till his old gray locks were wet with the dew of the night.</p>
