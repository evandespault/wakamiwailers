		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Lonely I walked by the banks of the river<br/>
			Watching the sunbeams as evening drew nigh<br/>
			As onward I rambled, I spied a fair damsel.<br/>
			She was weeping and wailing with many a sigh.</p>

			<p>Crying for one who was now lying lonely.<br/>
			Sighing for one who no mortal could save.<br/>
			The dark rolling waters flow gently all around him.<br/>
			And onward she walked o're to young Jimmy's grave.</p>

			<p>She cried "Oh my darling won't you come to my arms,<br/>
			And give me fond kisses like oft times before<br/>
			You promised to meet this evening my darling<br/>
			So now lovely Jimmy, arise from your grave."</p>

			<p>Slowly he rose from the banks of the river.<br/>
			A vision of beauty far fairer than the sun<br/>
			Pink and red were the garments all around him<br/>
			As on to this fair maid to speak he began.</p>

			<p>"Vain were the hopes that arose in my bosom.<br/>
			And nothing, oh nothing on earth could be saved<br/>
			My last dying thoughts were of God and you darling<br/>
			Till death took me down to this deep silent grave.</p>

			<p>One fond embrace love and then I must leave you.<br/>
			One loving farewell and then I must part."<br/>
			Cold were the arms that encircled all around her.<br/>
			Cold was the form that she pressed to her heart.</p>

			<p>Slowly he rose from the banks of the river<br/>
			And up to the sky he then seemed to go.<br/>
			She cried, "Oh my darling, my lost Jimmy Whelan<br/>
			I'll lie down and die at the side of your grave."</p>
