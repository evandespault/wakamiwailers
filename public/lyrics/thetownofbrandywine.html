		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Young Mary was a maiden when the birds began to sing;<br/>
			She was fairer than a blooming rose so early in the spring.<br/>
			Her heart was gay and merry on that morning fair and fine<br/>
			For her lover was a driver from the town of Brandywine.</p>

			<p>Young Charlie used a peavie with a driver's hand and skill,<br/>
			And he swung an axe with energy in the northern forest still.<br/>
			He would labour all the winter and in the summer in the pines<br/>
			And they called him Charlie Williams from the town of Brandywine</p>
	
			<p>Young Mary, she got married to her lover in the spring<br/>
			When the buds began to blossom and the birds began to sing.<br/>
			"I will labor all the winter and in summer in the pines<br/>
			I'll return to you, my darling, when the fruit is on the vine."</p>

			<p>Young Mary she was faded and no more was gazed upon,<br/>
			For the happiness of her maiden dreams his wild career had run,<br/>
			And early one morning on Wisconsin dreary clime<br/>
			He had run those noisy rapids for his last sad fatal time.</p>

			<p>They found his body lying on the rocky shores below<br/>
			Where the noisy waters ripple and the silent cedars grow.<br/>
			"'I would send to her a letter, but I'm afraid that she'd recline,"<br/>
			Said a friend of Charlie Williams from the town of Brandywine.</p>

			<p>Now every raft of timber that goes down the Chippewa<br/>
			His lonesome grave is visited by drivers on their way.<br/>
			They will plant wild flowers o'er his grave and pluck the weaving vines<br/>
			On the grave of Charlie Williams on the river through the pine.</p>

			<p>In a distance city I visited not many months ago<br/>
			It was in a southern climate where strange faces come and go<br/>
			I saw a gray haired damsel and no more her eyes did shine<br/>
			It was the widow of young Williams from the town of Brandywine</p>

			<p>She smiled as she saw me and she looked so old a gray<br/>
			"I'm prepared to meet my river boy." those words to me did say,<br/>
			"And it's early in the autumn when the fruit is on the vine<br/>
			I will welcome back my river boy to the town of Brandywine"</p>
