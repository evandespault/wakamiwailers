		<div class="lyrics">

			<p>When I was young and in my prime<br/>
			I thought I'd go for a river driver<br/>
			And I met an old man on the shore,<br/>
			He said, "Son, better watch white water."</p>

			<p><b>Break and go, I tell you so,<br/>
			Logjams like young men like you!</b></p>

			<p>I just laughed and I laughed some more -<br/>
			What was I but a bold young rover?<br/>
			And I left him on the shore<br/>
			That was before I knew white water.</p>

			<p>What was I but a bold young fool<br/>
			And it wasn't long till I learned better<br/>
			That's when young MacPherson drowned<br/>
			He was gone with a roar when the jam turned over.</p>
	
			<p>So we dragged him to the shore<br/>
			Carved his name in the bark of a cedar<br/>
			Hung his boots on a hanging limb -<br/>
			Mac had gone too near the water.</p>

			<p>Logjams come and logjams go -<br/>
			Big or small, they all spell danger,<br/>
			You gotta have an old man on the shore<br/>
			When you're trying to get the key log out from under.</p>

			<p>Now I heed what the old man said -<br/>
			I listen to the words of the big boss driver<br/>
			When he's standing on the shore<br/>
			Telling young fellows how to handle timber.</p>

			<p><b>Break and go, it's now I see<br/>
			Log jams like young men like me!</b></p>
